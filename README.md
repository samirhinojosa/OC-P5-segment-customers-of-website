# Segment customers of an e-commerce site [OC-P5]

## **Problem to solve**

You are a consultant for **Olist**, a sales solution on online marketplaces. **Olist** wants you to provide their e-commerce teams with customer segmentation that they can use on a daily basis for their communication campaigns. 

You will need to provide the marketing team with an actionable description of your segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, as well as a maintenance contract proposal based on an analysis of the stability of the segments over time.

## **Your mission**

Your mission is to help the **Olist** teams understand the different types of users throught the following goals:

1. Understand the different types of users through their behavior and their personal data. 
2. Use unsupervised methods to group together clients of similar profiles / categories.

These categories can be used by the **Olist** marketing team to communicate better.

### **Considerations**

- For confidentiality reasons, **Olist** does not provide a lot of data, it's up to you to dig into what you have and create the best features to use it.

On the other hand, **Olist** has specified their request as follows:

- The proposed segmentation must be actionable and easy to use for the marketing team.
- You will assess how often the segmentation needs to be updated, in order to be able to perform a maintenance contract quote.
- The code provided must respect the PEP8 convention, to be usable by Olist.

## **The data**

For this mission, **Olist** has provided with an anonymized database containing information on order history, products purchased, satisfaction reviews, and customer location since January 2017.
